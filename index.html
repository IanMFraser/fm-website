                    I am a Digital Communications specialist with 

                    particular interest in community service and in the arts. Some of the creative and technical services that I 
                    
                    offer include copywriting, email campaigning, content creation, video editing, and web design. My skillset has accrued from a rich variety of work environments, 
                    
                    including a private archive, a tech startup, and an art gallery. In my personal life, I pursue digital art as a 
                    
                    hobby and occasionally provide artwork for friends in the computer music community.
