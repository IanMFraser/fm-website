                    I am a Digital Communications specialist with particular interest in community service and in the arts. Some of the creative and technical services that I offer include copywriting, email campaigning, content creation, video editing, and web design. Having developed my skillset in a rich variety of work environments, including a private archive, a tech startup, and an art gallery, I now serve as Communications Manager for the Concordia Summit. In my personal life, I pursue digital art as a hobby and occasionally provide artwork for friends in the computer music community.
